## C++ Smudges
### Defined : C++ Smudges - Minor errors or inconsistencies: small, almost unnoticeable mistakes, like formatting issues or slightly misaligned code, that don't necessarily break the program but make it less clean or readable. Incomplete or messy code: sections of code that are not fully developed, have placeholder values, or are generally disorganized. Code that needs refinement: functions but could be optimized for performance, readability, or maintainability.

I'll be posting config files and some code for public/free use here from time to time.
Be sure to *star* me, so I know if anyone is viewing the hub. I don't really care though, it's also a storage disc for me :)
